## INTRO
This Group project was created using a variety of languages, frameworks, and minds. Together we put together a Real Estate website that allows the logged in user to create a home or just explore homes. You can either check out homes that are not listed (not for sale) or homes that are listed. If interested, contact the realtor associated with the house to purchase. Furthermore, only the house creator/owner can edit or delete(sell) the home. Be sure to check out our filter search form t only view houses in the area of your choosing. Lastly, breath-taking images using AWS3 can be uploaded to show off all those square-feet. ENJOY the CRUD.
