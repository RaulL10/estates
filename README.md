## INTRO
This Group project was created using a variety of languages, frameworks, and minds. Together we put together a Real Estate website that allows the logged in user to create a home or just explore homes. You can either check out homes that are not listed (not for sale) or homes that are listed. If interested, contact the realtor associated with the house to purchase. Furthermore, only the house creator/owner can edit or delete(sell) the home. Be sure to check out our filter search form, to only view the houses in the area of your choosing. Lastly, breath-taking images using AWS3 can be uploaded to show off all those square-feet. ENJOY the CRUD.

##### NEXT STEPS
To further add-on to the project there are a few things we'd like to see:
1. In house details we would like the Users to be able to directly be routed to the realtors info if they would like to purchase the home
2. Also, put an offer on the house directly in an "offer section" below the home price info
